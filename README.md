# Legacy-Open-IE

This is a Java maven project showing use of [OpenIE-4](https://github.com/allenai/openie-standalone) and Stanford [OpenIE](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/openie.html). Please see their project page and licenses (especially the OpenIE license, as its particularly restrictive). The project requies Java 8 or higher. 

## Installation

Install via Maven. Note that we are using OpenIE-4, but OpenIE-5 has been released with minor changes. You can view new releases [here](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Copenie).

## Purpose

We created this repo to benchmark rule-based systems. We found them to be unsatisfactory for our use cases, and have started developing of Squadie (an open information extraction corpus based on SQuAD) and Nopie (a neural open information extractor).
